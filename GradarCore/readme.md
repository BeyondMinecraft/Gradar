# Gregory-Gradar-Core

## What Is It?
This mod is the Core part of my radar mod; borrowing features from the RadarBro mod;
it has a rendered mini-map overlay on the screen, with configurable options for player
customization. Two additional mods support this one, with "IFF" and "Waypoint storage"
options.

## How Do I ... ?
If this mod is installed (and no other radar mods are), the player should see the map
rendered in the upper-right corner of the screen when logged into a world. With a few
key-presses, this mod can be configured to the player's preferences.

## Final Thoughts.
This is intended to provide a comfortable enhancement over the RadarBro mod. I do not
create this radar mod with the intention of allowing player cheating; however, it is
meant to be of benefit in single-player as well as cooperative multiplayer modes.
