## What Is It?
The Gradar 'Identify-Friend-or-Foe System' is meant to supplement multiplayer gaming
sessions by allowing the storing of friends and enemies lists of player names.

## How Do I ... ?
A gui screen will allow the player to add player's names as either friends or enemies
of the current player.

## Final Thoughts.
Remember, Minecraft is still just a game; your friends can and should stay friends,
but do not make players on your enemies list a target of personal vendetta. Have fun.
