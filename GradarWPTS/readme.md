# Gregory-Gradar-WPTS

## What Is It?
This is my Gradar system's "Waypoint Tracking System", or 'WPTS' for short. With it,
a player can keep a list of waypoints that is automatically sorted for the specific
dimension where the player is located.

## How Do I ... ?
A gui screen allows entering and modifying a list of waypoints in the world. If the
configuration item for adding a default waypoint is enabled, a new waypoint will be
created when the player logs in or changes dimension where no waypoint currently
exists.

## Final Thoughts.
Like the IFFS lists, these waypoints are for the player only; at some future edition
I may support sharing of waypoints among friends (say, among members of a same Team).
Additional suggestions can be given, as well as bug reports to the Github repository
issue-tracker.
